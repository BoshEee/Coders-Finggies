1. You can add your peace of code so other can also practice this one
2. comment on the code you practiced
3. A small hub to share ideas

The Idea is to help the coders to practice to type fast as coders not just words, in the same time they will be practicing a real function so they while practicing they can learn more
fuctions and facts about coding and programming. Also, I want to build a small community with this by adding users system to save their progress and conect with others, also to some new different functions while learning and typing.
